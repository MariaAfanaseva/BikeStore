                                DH terrain comes at you fast.
                                You need the confidence and control to make split-second
                                decisions and commit to your lines.
                                With 203mm of fully active Maestro Suspension
                                featuring a trunnion-mount shock,
                                the Glory 27.5 has been tested and proven by some
                                of the top DH racers and gravity riders in the world.
                                Its lightweight, super-strong frame is engineered with
                                geometry thatâ€™s optimized for its 27.5 wheels, plus a
                                super stiff OverDrive steerer tube for unwavering control
                                and steering precision. The 63-degree headtube angle and
                                longer wheelbase was developed and refined with riders
                                from the Giant Factory Off-Road Team to excel on the
                                steepest, most extreme DH tracks in the world.
